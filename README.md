This project is an exercise for practising and improving javascript and css skills, with personal additions as the "Play again" and "New game" buttons. 

During this project  I have learnt more about the structure of arrow functions and special functions such as: 

- setInterval(() => {})
- setTimeout(() => {}, 1000)

Besides I have found very useful the method window.location.reload() to reload the page.

### MoSCoW Prioritisation

I broke down my Epics into stories before prioritising and implementing them.
By following this method, I applied MoSCoW prioritisation and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration
